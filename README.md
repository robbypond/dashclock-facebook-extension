Dashclock Facebook Extension
============================

DashClock Facebook Extension is an extension for DashClock that allows you to quickly see your latest facebook notifications on your lock screen. You can either view messages or notifications or both configurable through preferences.

When you login, first I request the read_mailbox permission to get your inbox unread count, and then I request the manage_notifications permission, these permissions must be requested separate because one is read and the other is publish. My app only reads messages/notifications. I do not use these permissions to publish anything to your facebook feed.

DashClock Facebook Extensions can be downloaded on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brennasoft.facebookdashclockextension).
